h2. Installation:

Currently you can simply copy the files in the ColorChooser directory into your project.

h2. Getting started:

Take a look at the chooseColor1 to chooseColor4 methods in SimpleColorChooserViewController.m 
The ArsColorChooserViewController is allocated and then initialized with a delegate and two selectors, one which will return the chosen color and one which will be called if the chooser is canceled.
You should set a current color for the color chooser and can decide to pass in localized strings for the title and the label of the alpha slider, then simply present the controller as a modal view controller. On iPad you should use UIModalPresentationFormSheet as modalPresentationStyle.
You are responsible for dismissing the chooser in the delegate methods.
